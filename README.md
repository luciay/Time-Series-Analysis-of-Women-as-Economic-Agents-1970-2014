TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS ON BEHAVIORS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS ECONOMIC AGENTS 
by Lucia Yu and Meredith Mante

The analysis seeks to examine the larger social attitudes about women in the work force and its effect on female participation in the overall workforce from 1970-2014. 

While much research has been dedicated to both the corporate and academic pipeline, this project seeks to focus on the less emphasized, overarching social sentiments towards women as economic agents as a potent influence on participation in the field.The four main factors examined were: 
1) the overall percent change inflation-adjusted income of women in the workforce for each year,
2) average job prestige of women-held occupations per year,
3) the percent change in support of women in the labor force and affirmative action measures from all respondents, and
4) the percent change of job satisfaction for female respondents in the workforce.

Granger Causation was the main method of time-series analysis. ARIMA forecasting was conducted on the percent participation of men and women in the workforce and percent change in income, using the last five data points and looking five data points into the future. 

A few notable findings include:
1) Change in both overall and female support for female economic agents causes changes in female labor participation,
2) Change in female income causes change in support for female economic agents, and 
3) Change in support for female economic agents causes change in female job prestige.

Data was collected from the GSS conducted by the US Census Bureau, and can be found at https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/.
